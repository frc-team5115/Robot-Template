# Robot-Template
This code provides a basic tank drive robot with no other systems and no autonomous. It conforms to all the standards set by the *5115 Guide to Code Style and Structure*.

All 5115 robot code should begin by copying this code into a new repository. Doing this gives new code a robust foundation and allows programmers to avoid retyping code that is used every year.
